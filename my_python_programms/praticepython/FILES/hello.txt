Make sure to replace your_home_folder with your computer username. 

For example, my username is asweigart, so I’d enter 'C:\\Users\\asweigart\\
hello.txt' on Windows.
Both these commands will open the file in “reading plaintext” mode, 
or read mode for short. When a file is opened in read mode, Python lets you 
only read data from the file; you can’t write or modify it in any way. Read 
mode is the default mode for files you open in Python. But if you don’t want 
to rely on Python’s defaults, you can explicitly specify the mode by passing 
the string value 'r' as a second argument to open(). So open('/Users/asweigart/
hello.txt', 'r') and open('/Users/asweigart/hello.txt') do the same thing.
The call to open() returns a File object. A File object represents a file on 
your computer; it is simply another type of value in Python, much like the 
lists and dictionaries you’re already familiar with. In the previous example, 
you stored the File object in the variable helloFile. Now, whenever you want 
to read from or write to the file, you can do so by calling methods on the 
File object in helloFile.
